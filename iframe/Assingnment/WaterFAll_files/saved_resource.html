    <h1>Memories</h1>
    <p>Monsoons are a magical time when the landscape turns verdant green, it is the season to explore forts, go on treks and discover waterfalls cascading from hills and mountains! Be it big or small, waterfalls are a monsoon wonder that we cannot get enough
        of! We recently came across Kalu Waterfall in Malshej Ghat which is the highest waterfall in the region and fairly lesser-known so if you are bitten by the adventure keeda, then you need to get on your bike and go explore this waterfall, right
        now!</p>
