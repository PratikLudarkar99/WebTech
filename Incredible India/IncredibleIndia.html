                <h1><b>Taj Mahal:- </b></h1>
                <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar
                    Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the
                    tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal;
                    it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
                    <br>India is a land of rich culture, diversity, topography, and history, which makes it a wonderful
                    country, wherein every state there is something worth seeing. The historical monuments and ancient
                    architecture, all add to the beauty
                    of the country with an abundance of history to tell. Thus with the public polls, India has decided
                    the seven wonders of India, which everyone should explore and know about. As it is important to get
                    acquainted with the rich heritage
                    of India and the cultures and traditions associated with it.
                    <br> The seven wonders of India, are the marvelous masterpieces of architecture, which will take you
                    back in time and make you mesmerize the olden days. The wonders include a monolith, places of
                    worship, even a university and a mausoleum.
                    Let's explore and cherish the beauty of the past in today's time.
                    <br>White marble mausoleum Taj Mahal is located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, which is only 200 Km
                    from New Delhi, the capital of India. It was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his
                    third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj
                    Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired
                    masterpieces of the world's heritage". Around 20,000 people worked day and night for twenty-two
                    years to complete construction of the
                    Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal was constructed using the best quality marble from Rajasthan, Tibet,
                    Afghanistan, and China. At different times of the day, the Taj Mahal appears to be in a different
                    color. Some believe that these changing
                    colors depict the changing moods of a woman. It's not just a Seven Wonders of India, but it is also
                    listed among the Seven Wonders of Medieval World and very popular among the Indian and foreign
                    tourists.

                <h1><b>Ellora Caves:-</b></h1>
                <p>Ellora Caves, Ellora also spelled Elura, a series of 34 magnificent rock-cut temples in
                    northwest-central Maharashtra state, western India. They are located near the village of Ellora, 19
                    miles (30 km) northwest of Aurangabad and 50 miles
                    (80 km) southwest of the Ajanta Caves. Spread over a distance of 1.2 miles (2 km), the temples were
                    cut from basaltic cliffs and have elaborate facades and interior walls. The Ellora complex was
                    designated a UNESCO World Heritage site
                    in 1983. The 12 Buddhist caves (in the south) date from about 200 BCE to 600 CE, the 17 Hindu
                    temples (in the centre) date from about 500 to 900 CE, and the 5 Jain temples (in the north) date
                    from about 800 to 1000. The Hindu caves
                    are the most dramatic in design, and the Buddhist caves contain the simplest ornamentation. Ellora
                    served as a group of monasteries (viharas) and temples (caityas); some of the caves include sleeping
                    cells that were carved for itinerant
                    monks.
                    <br> The most remarkable of the cave temples is Kailasa (Kailasanatha; cave 16), named for the
                    mountain in the Kailas Range of the Himalayas where the Hindu god Shiva resides. Unlike other
                    temples at the site, which were first delved
                    horizontally into the rock face, the Kailasa complex was excavated downward from a basaltic slope
                    and is therefore largely exposed to sunlight. Construction of the temple in the 8th century,
                    beginning in the reign of Krishna I (c.
                    756–773), involved the removal of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of solid rock. The complex measures some
                    164 feet (50 metres) long, 108 feet (33 metres) wide, and 100 feet (30 metres) high and has four
                    levels, or stories. It contains elaborately
                    carved monoliths and halls with stairs, doorways, windows, and numerous fixed sculptures. One of its
                    better-known decorations is a scene of Vishnu transformed into a man-lion and battling a demon. Just
                    beyond the entrance, in the main
                    courtyard, is a monument to Shiva’s bull Nandi. Along the walls of the temple, at the second-story
                    level, are life-size sculptures of elephants and other animals. Among the depictions within the
                    halls is that of the 10-headed demon
                    king Ravana shaking Kailasa mountain in a show of strength. Erotic and voluptuous representations of
                    Hindu divinities and mythological figures also grace the temple. Some features have been damaged or
                    destroyed over the centuries,
                    such as a rock-hewn footbridge that once joined two upper-story thresholds.The Vishvakarma cave
                    (cave 10) has carvings of Hindu and Buddhist figures as well as a lively scene of dancing dwarfs.
                    Notable among the Jain temples is cave
                    32, which includes fine carvings of lotus flowers and other elaborate ornaments. Each year the caves
                    attract large crowds of religious pilgrims and tourists. The annual Ellora Festival of Classical
                    Dance and Music is held there in
                    the third week of March.

                <h1><b>Ajanta Caves:-</b></h1>
                <p>Ajanta Caves, Buddhist rock-cut cave temples and monasteries, located near Ajanta village,
                    north-central Maharashtra state, western India, that are celebrated for their wall paintings. The
                    temples are hollowed out of granite cliffs on
                    the inner side of a 70-foot (20-metre) ravine in the Wagurna River valley 65 miles (105 km)
                    northeast of Aurangabad, at a site of great scenic beauty
                    <br>The group of some 30 caves was excavated between the 1st century BCE and the 7th century CE and
                    consists of two types, caityas (“sanctuaries”) and viharas (“monasteries”). Although the sculpture,
                    particularly the rich ornamentation
                    of the caitya pillars, is noteworthy, it is the fresco-type paintings that are the chief interest of
                    Ajanta. These paintings depict colourful Buddhist legends and divinities with an exuberance and
                    vitality that is unsurpassed in Indian
                    art. The caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

                <h1><b>Lonar Crater Lake:-</b> </h1>
                <p>I quickly tried to adjust my eyes to the sudden bright light. I stepped out of the bus, still
                    slightly groggy from my power nap and looked as far as my vision permitted — a vast, desolate
                    stretch of land with not much in sight, barring
                    a few trees, and the blazing sun. I walked a few steps further and spotted a sliver of green, which
                    soon paved the way for a massive lake, shining under the harsh
                    <br>After an excruciatingly long and seemingly endless journey from Aurangabad, we reached the Lonar
                    Crater on a hot, dusty afternoon. According to mythology, Lonar acquired its name from Lonasura, a
                    demon who was killed by Lord Vishnu.
                    The crater and the lake which reside in a quiet corner of the Buldhana district in the state of
                    Maharashtra made headlines nearly two years ago, when the water of the lake turned pink (more on
                    that later), once again grabbing eyeballs
                    after almost two centuries — since its discovery. Talking about the lake’s discovery takes one back
                    in time, almost two centuries ago when J.E. Alexander first discovered it.
                    <br>Over the years various stories — both mythological and scientific — revolved around the creation
                    of the crater, its water and its significance. But what was upheld in the end was a result of a deep
                    scientific study that took a
                    while to come to fruition. Classified as a Geo-heritage monument — with both saline and alkaline
                    water — the crater is believed to be a result of a meteor collision. Today it even stands as a
                    wildlife sanctuary for the conservation
                    of animals, plants as well as the water of the lake.
                    <br> A slight rustle of the leaves and I was brought back to real time, only to dive back into
                    Buldana’s history and its ancient tales. The Buldana district where the Lonar Crater is located has
                    traded various hands in terms of its
                    rulers. It was once a part of the Maurya empire and later ruled by the Chalukyas, Mughals, Yadavas,
                    Nizams and the British for significant periods of time and it was during the reign of these rulers
                    that trade flourished in the region.
                    While not all rulers left behind a historical trail, the Yadavas have left a legacy behind in the
                    form of temples, namely Gomukh, Daitya Sudan, Kamalja Devi amongst others. While here, one can find
                    numerous small temples dotted along
                    the periphery of the lake. Known as Yadava temples, they are flocked by the locals during dawn and
                    dusk. As for us, the heat was a major deterrent, and hence the best advised time to visit the crater
                    is during the months of October
                    to early March. A few metres away from the main lake — approximately seven metres if some are to be
                    believed — lies a small circular depression that is believed to be caused by a fragment of the main
                    meteor. And right next to this
                    small lake — known as Ambar Lake or the chota Lonar — one can find a Hanuman temple. It is only upon
                    visiting that one realises that the area surrounding the lake is doused in history, mythology and
                    science in equal measures. The Lonar
                    Crater is truly a cosmic wonder. Come to think of it, a slight movement in the cosmos and an
                    indelible imprint — as deep as 500 feet and 1.8 kilometres wide — has permanently found home in a
                    plateau in Maharashtra

                    till the basement. Soon after, his successor Iltutmush constructed the next three storeys and then
                    Firoz Shah Tughluk constructed the fifth storey. The Qutub Minar is also compared to the Leaning
                    Tower of Pisa, owing to its structure.
                    There are 379 steps inside the tower, but unfortunately these have been closed to the public for
                    quite a while now. You can visit this famous landmark between 6 am to 6 pm.</p>
